## Introduction <br>
<p>
In this project, wind speed and precipitation rate data taken from surface buoys off the Oregon coast were examined from April 2018 to April 2019. The two locations under examination were "Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring" and "Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring."

In both cross-correlation calculations, data from Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring led Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring by about eight days. These near-identical lag values suggest that weather systems pass over the Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring sensor, then move out toward the Pacific where they pass over the Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring sensor.
## Conclusion
